 '''-> Type Conversion & Type Casting

    -> Type Conversion

        -> Conversion of one datatype to another data type

        -> Implicit (You Don't need to do) --> Python interpreter will do it automatically

            -> Automatic Conversion - Widening (Taking Smaller Data Type and Putting in Larger DT)

        -> NOTE: NO DATA LOSS WILL OCCUR


    -> Type Casting

        -> Conversion of one datatype to another data type

        -> Explicit Conversion (You need to do) --> Manually you need to perform Type Casting

            -> No Automatic Conversion - Narrowing (Taking Larger Data Type and Putting in Smaller DT)

        -> NOTE: DATA LOSS WILL OCCUR    

    -> NOTE: If you attempt to convert Incompatible Types i.e converting a non-numeric string
    ti integer we get Errors.'''
